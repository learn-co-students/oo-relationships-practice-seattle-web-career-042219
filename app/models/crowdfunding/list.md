Deliverables
You are building the next big crowdfunding site. Users can make projects and fund projects. Oh the projects!

your models are users, projects and pledges
a project will have a pledge goal amount
a user can both create and back projects, so a user will have multiple connections to projects based on those different roles
Write out the relationships using has_many, belongs_to and has_many_through. Write out a schema that shows what these tables might look like in a database. Where would the foreign keys live? Then build out methods reflecting all these relationships. What method can I call on a user to find other users who have backed his/her projects, etc?
