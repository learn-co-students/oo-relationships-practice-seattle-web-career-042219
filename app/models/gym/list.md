You are building an app for a gym. But this is not just any gym. It has many locations and many trainers. Each trainer has clients that can work out of any location provided that they have a trainer.

your models are locations, trainers and clients

a location has many trainers
a trainer has many locations
a trainer has many clients
a client has one trainer

in imdb, char had 1 actor. 
actor was name only in the console.
char took a name and the actor object in the console.
char had actor as attr_ in its file

so trainer is name only in console.
client takes name and trainer in console
clinet has trainer in attr_accessor



how is a client related to a location?
Write out the relationships using has_many, belongs_to and has_many_through. Write out a schema that shows what these tables might look like in a database. Where would the foreign keys live? Then build out methods reflecting all these relationships. What method can I call on a location to find all its clients, etc?

location = trainer = client

### Client
# assign_trainer
[x] should take a trainer as argument and assign it to the client
### Location
[x].least_clients
should find which location has the least clients training there. 
### Trainer
[x].most_clients
should find which trainer has the most clients.
